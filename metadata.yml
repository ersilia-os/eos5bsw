Title: Small molecule retention by Gram-negative bacteria based on a large-scale LC/MS
  screen
Description: A high-throughput LC/MS assay was used to measure uptake and retention
  of ca. 13, 000 small molecules. A total of 6, 416 compounds were classified either
  as retention-positive or -negative. Of these 45% were positives in the TolC mutant,
  with 60% not retained in the wild-type strain, indicating efficient efflux. Here,
  we use our baseline modeling tool LazyQSAR to build a retention prediction model
  based on this data.
