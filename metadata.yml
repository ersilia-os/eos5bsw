Title: Small molecule retention by Gram-negative bacteria based on a large-scale
  LC/MS screen
Description: A high-throughput LC/MS assay was used to measure uptake and 
  retention of ca. 13, 000 small molecules. A total of 6, 416 compounds were 
  classified either as retention-positive or -negative. Of these 45% were 
  positives in the TolC mutant, with 60% not retained in the wild-type strain, 
  indicating efficient efflux. Here, we use our baseline modeling tool LazyQSAR 
  to build a retention prediction model based on this data.
